TF-IDF

A friend of yours wants to build a basic search engine and starts reading up
on information extraction. He decides to try a simple implementation of
TF-IDF, a measure of the information content a term holds for a particular
document in a document collection. However, he just started learning to code
and somehow his numbers do not match what is expected. He knows you're
enrolled in an awesome developer school, so he asks you to have a look.

# Term frequency - inverse document frequency:
# A measure of how important a term is to a document in a collection of documents
# (the importance increases proportionally to the term frequency in the document,
# but decreases with the frequency of the word across documents)

def tfidf(term, document, documents)
  tf(term, document) * idf(term, documents)
end

# Term frequency (simple version):
# the number of times a term occurs in a document

def tf(term, document)
  document.split(/[\s-]/).count { |word| word.downcase == term }
end

# Inverse document frequency:
# measure of how much information the word provides,
# based on the number of documents in which it occurs
# (the rarer it is, the more information it provides)

def idf(term, documents)
  number_of_documents = documents.length
  number_of_documents_with_term = documents.count { |d| tf(term, d) > 0 }
  
  Math.log(number_of_documents / number_of_documents_with_term)
end

# Very simple example

My answer:
Line 37 perform integer division which is the source of error.
To fix this, we cast one of the values to a float.

Solution

def idf(term, documents)
  number_of_documents = documents.length
  number_of_documents_with_term = documents.count { |d| tf(term, d) > 0 }

  Math.log(number_of_documents.fdiv(number_of_documents_with_term))
end

Discussion

In the definition of our original idf method, we perform division on two
values which will both be integers. The division will therefore be performed
as integer division, meaning it will produce an integer value, namely the
integer part of the result without the remainder (for example, 1/2 will
evaluate to 0 instead of 0.5).

Let's take a closer look at our first test case. The term "cat" occurs in 2
of 3 documents, which returns an idf value of Math.log(3/2) => Math.log(1) => 0.

In order to return a float value, we must perform float division. We can do
this by either converting one or both values to a floating point number using
Integer#to_f, or by using the Numeric#fdiv method as seen in the above solution.

The idf value of "cat" is then correctly calculated as Math.log(3.fdiv(2)) 
=> Math.log(1.5) => 0.4054651081081644. The tfidf method multiplies the returned
idf by the tf value for document1 (which is 3, because "cat" occurs three times
in that document) and returns the expected output of ~1.2 for the first example.

Further Exploration

There's still one issue that could get us into trouble when performing division.
If you don't see it immediately, remove document1 from the documents collection
and check the TF-IDF value of 'quantum' again.

Potential bug => division by zero resulting in infinity value

TO REVIEW
- Math.log(2/0) => Raise ZeroDivisionError
- Math.log(2.0/0) => no error but return Infinity
- Integer#fdiv
  
  fdiv(numeric) → float

  Returns the floating point result of dividing int by numeric.

  654321.fdiv(13731)      #=> 47.652829364212366
  654321.fdiv(13731.24)   #=> 47.65199646936475
  -654321.fdiv(13731)     #=> -47.652829364212366

- String#split(/[\s-]/).count { |word| word.downcase == term }
