Stringy Strings

Write a method that takes one argument, a positive integer, and returns
a string of alternating 1s and 0s, always starting with 1. The length
of the string should match the given integer.

Examples:

puts stringy(6) == '101010'
puts stringy(9) == '101010101'
puts stringy(4) == '1010'
puts stringy(7) == '1010101'

The tests above should print true.

Problem
Input: An Integer
Output: A string of alternating binary characters, starting with '1'

Clarifications
- Can input be negative or 0? No it is a positive integer as specified.

Examples
- See above

Data Structure
- Input: Integer
- Output: Strings
- Intermediary: An array holding the alternating binary number 

Initial thoughts
- To get a binary, we can modulo a number by 2 which will return 0 or 1. 
- To start with 1 our sequence should start with 1 and repeat till n, our input integer.
1..n range sounds suitable

Algorithm
- Create empty result array
- For each element in sequence 1 to n, push element % 2 into result array
- Join elements in result array with '' as delimiter

=end

def stringy(length)
  result_array = []
  for i in 1..length
    result_array << i % 2 # modulo 2 only returns 0 or 1, for both positive or negative numbers
  end
  
  result_array.join
end


puts stringy(6) == '101010'
puts stringy(9) == '101010101'
puts stringy(4) == '1010'
puts stringy(7) == '1010101'

Solution

def stringy(size)
  numbers = []

  size.times do |index|
    number = index.even? ? 1 : 0
    numbers << number
  end

  numbers.join
end

Discussion

Performing a task a certain number of times should be fairly straightforward at this point. 
We use #times to iterate based on the number indicated by size. For each iteration, we use
the index block parameter in a conditional to determine if the current number is even or odd.
Since #times starts counting from 0, we know that the first number will be even. Knowing this,
we can write our conditional to return 1 if index is even and 0 if index is odd.

We assign that value to a variable and, on the next line, we add it to an array, numbers.
After #times has finished iterating, we're left with an array filled with 1s and 0s in the
correct order. Now, all we have to do is invoke numbers.join to return the desired output.

Further Exploration

Modify stringy so it takes an additional optional argument that defaults to 1. If the method
is called with this argument set to 0, the method should return a String of alternating 0s
and 1s, but starting with 0 instead of 1.


TO REVIEW
Array#join using "" empty string as delimiter to join by default

https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.6.0/Array.html#method-i-join

join(separator=$,) â†’ str click to toggle source

Returns a string created by converting each element of the array to a string, separated
by the given separator. If the separator is nil, it uses current $,. If both the separator
and $, are nil, it uses an empty string.

[ "a", "b", "c" ].join        #=> "abc"
[ "a", "b", "c" ].join("-")   #=> "a-b-c"
