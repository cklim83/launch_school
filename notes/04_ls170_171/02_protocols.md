# Protocols

## Why Do We Need Protocols?
The internet is made up of a **giant myriad of devices** (PCs, laptops, servers, 
smartphones, TVs, IOT devices etc) that are connected by different make and
models of **networking equipments** (hubs, switches and routers) that collectively
run a massive variety of **software**. To **allow everything to interoperate**, 
we need protocols to govern how data exchanges should take place.

## What Are Protocols?
Protocols are essentially a set of rules governing the exchange or transmission
of data for network communication. 

## Common Protocols

    IP
    SMTP 
    TCP
    HTTP
    Ethernet
    FTP
    DNS
    UDP
    TLS


Many protocols were developed because
- Different protocols were developed to address different aspects of network
  communication.
- Different protocols were developed to address the same aspect of network
  communication, but in a different way or for a specific use-case.

**TCP and UDP** would be examples of two protocols that address the same basic
aspect of communication, the **transfer of messages between applications**, but
do so in different ways. **TCP and HTTP** would be examples of two protocols that
address **different aspects** of communication; TCP for the transfer of messages
between applications, and **HTTP for the structure of those messages**.
