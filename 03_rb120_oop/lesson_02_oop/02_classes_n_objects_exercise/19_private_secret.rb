Using the following code, add a method named share_secret that prints
the value of @secret when invoked.

class Person
  attr_writer :secret

  private

  attr_reader :secret
end

person1 = Person.new
person1.secret = 'Shh.. this is a secret!'
person1.share_secret

Expected output:

Shh.. this is a secret!
=end

class Person
  attr_writer :secret
  
  def share_secret
    puts "#{secret}"
  end
  
  private

  attr_reader :secret
end

person1 = Person.new
person1.secret = 'Shh.. this is a secret!'
person1.share_secret


=begin
Solution

class Person
  attr_writer :secret

  def share_secret
    puts secret
  end

  private

  attr_reader :secret
end

person1 = Person.new
person1.secret = 'Shh.. this is a secret!'
person1.share_secret

Discussion

Sometimes, certain instance methods don't need to be accessed outside
the class. Therefore, it's better to make them private methods, which
means they can only be invoked from within the class. We can define
methods as private by calling private before the method definition.

We can invoke a private method from within the class just like we would
with any other method. The important thing to realize here is that
private methods can't be invoked from outside the class, like this:

class Person
  attr_writer :secret

  private

  attr_reader :secret
end

person1 = Person.new
person1.secret = 'Shh.. this is a secret!'
person1.secret # => private method `secret' called for #<Person:0x007fef1986ac08 @secret="Shh.. this is a secret!"> (NoMethodError)

We get a NoMethodError because secret is a private getter method.


CONCEPTS
- Private methods cannot be accessed outside a class e.g. by an object 
  of that class but can be accessed anywhere inside the class
- Methods below the private method invocations are made private
- We can access private methods by public methods
