Does the following statement use the DDL or DML component of SQL?

```sql
INSERT INTO things VALUES (3, 'Scissors', 'Metal');
```

My answer:
DML. `INSERT INTO` serves to insert data into a table and hence is part of the DML.


Solution

DML

`INSERT` adds new rows of data into a database. Therefore, it is part of the DML sublanguage since it manipulates the data and not the structure of the data.
