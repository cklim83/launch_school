Does the following statement use the DDL or DML component of SQL?

```sql
DELETE FROM things WHERE item = 'Cup';
```

My answer:
DML. `DELETE` is use to delete rows of data from a table and is part of DML.


Solution

DML

Discussion

`DELETE` statements delete specific rows of data in a database. Therefore, it is part of the DML sublanguage since it manipulates the data and not the structure of the data.
