A simple file-based content management system. This project uses the filesystem to persist data and as a result, it isn't a good fit for Heroku. Applications running on Heroku only have access to an ephemeral filesystem. This means any files that are written by a program will be lost each time the application goes to sleep, is redeployed, or restarts (which typically happens every 24 hours).

This project will, however, run just fine within a local development environment.
