Does the following statement use the DDL or DML component of SQL?

```sql
UPDATE things
SET material = 'plastic'
WHERE item = 'Cup';
```

My answer:
DML. `UPDATE` is used to change values of data in a table and is part of DML.


Solution

DML
Discussion

`UPDATE` modifies specific rows of data in a database. Therefore, it is part of the DML sublanguage since it manipulates the data and not the structure of the data.
