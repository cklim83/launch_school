Does the following statement use the Data Definition Language (DDL) or the Data Manipulation Language (DML) component of SQL?

```sql
SELECT column_name FROM my_table;
```

My answer:
This is a `SELECT` statement, which is part of the Data Manipulation Language and is used to retrieve information from a database.

DML

`SELECT` merely queries (reads) the data in a database. Since it manipulates the data and not the structure of the data, `SELECT` is part of the DML sublanguage.
